### Steps for Running Locally
1. Clone or copy your project.
2. Create an ElevenLabs account for the API. The API is free but has a limitation of 10,000 words per month.
3. Create a '.env' file in your project and add the ElevenLabs API key.
4. Run the backend part in an IDE (e.g., VS Code). By default, it will run at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
5. Open and run the frontend, typically an index.html file.




### Steps for Deploying on a Server
1. Choose a server provider (e.g., Vultr, AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.).
2. Set up the server.
3. If Vultr is chosen, log in to your Vultr account and deploy a new server.
4. Create a block storage volume for storing images and audio clips. Attach the block storage volume to your server.
5. Open PuTTY or Git Bash (depending on your preference) and use your SSH key to log in.
6. Update the system and install the required dependencies.
7. Create a '.env' file in your project and add the ElevenLabs API key, 'BLOCK_STORAGE_PATH', 'BLOCK_STORAGE_URL', and 'BLOCK_STORAGE_TOKEN' (or Vultr API Key   *BLOCK_STORAGE_TOKEN = Vultr API Key*).
8. Upload your project using WinSCP or scp.
9. Set up a virtual environment.
10. Configure Nginx and automate Gunicorn with Systemd.
11. Access your app:
    - If using a domain: http://your_domain
    - If using an IP: http://your_server_ip
